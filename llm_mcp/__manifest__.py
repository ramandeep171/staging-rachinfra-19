        Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration for Odoo LLM

        This module extends LLM integration in Odoo by adding support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP),
        allowing connection to external MCP-compliant servers that provide tool implementations. Key features include:

        - Connect to external MCP servers via standard I/O communication
        - Auto-discover and register tools exposed by MCP servers
        - Execute MCP tools through LLM conversations
        - Support for the JSON-RPC 2.0 based Model Context Protocol standard
        - Simple management interface for MCP server connections
